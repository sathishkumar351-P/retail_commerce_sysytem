The Retail & Commerce System is a web-based application developed using JSP, Servlets, JDBC, and Oracle Database.

The system allows users to:
Add retail transaction details
view a specific retail transaction
View all retail transactions
This application is designed with a layered architecture including Bean, DAO, Service, Utility, and Servlet layers.

Project Objective:

To develop an online application that stores and retrieves retail transaction details such as:
